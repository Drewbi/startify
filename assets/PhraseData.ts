  `For thousands of years, floating, protective blume-like colonies of fungi have inhabited some of the world's deepest, darkest and most remote marine environments. These fungi, when first discovered by Man, first gave new meaning to the phrase "the unfathomed." Researchers from the School of Public Health at the University of Maryland and Columbia University have described for the first time a new, more ancient species of the genus Schistosoma, which is found most commonly in the waters around the tropics.`,
  `Work on the space station's Integrated Truss Structure, or ITS, will begin after all the spaceships leave Earth and roll to their final launch point. The space station will support a fleet of 22 taxis, a shuttle-sized science lab and six astronauts who will use three quarters of the space station's habitable volume.`,
  `Synchronised bottom-line open system ironing machine; which can solve for the power needs of up to 14 hammers at a time; along with larger cloth jackets and ovens that can save £100 per week; in places where there is an oven.The Reindeer can also be used for ironing things, whether it is cooked or raw, like meat and game. Here, with another enormous tent, they can take the biggest carcass of a deer or caribou, for example, and iron all the way to the Czech Republic. This is possible because the Reindeer can automatically make a pathway from the yard up to the tent, using a hydraulic pump.`,
  `Block-based workflows are a type of project workflow used to create, manage, and perform complex complex tasks, such as testing, integration, and automation. Block-based workflow can be used to schedule tasks, communicate between devices or teams, automate testing or integration with systems, etc. Many block-based workflows are managed via Microsoft Project, the internal workflow system and hosted in the`,

  `While laws are in place to deter possible crime, various wildlife populations have demonstrated strong territorial reactions to vehicles, trappers, and other human activity. Coyotes and mountain lions also harbor fear and distrust of vehicles, based on an innate distrust of large-scale vehicles, and this applies to their possible interactions with paintballers.`,

  `Under pressure from the CEOs of Warren Buffett and Amazon and from the suitors, OSI eventually changed its name to Intel Security. The name change may have reduced public anxiety, but it is unclear how it resolved the anxiety in the executive suites. Since then, Intel Security has done less than splendid business, with a long list of embarrassing mistakes.`,
  `When organizations get smaller, their focus becomes to carry out work faster and at the expense of ensuring results. In an environment of aggressive managing and project challenges, CREST may prove to be a valuable tools to mitigate workload stress and improve efficiency. To ensure high-level insights in integrated program planning, work with partnering agencies to carefully conceptualize and analyze planning activities to benefit CREST-sensitive partners.`,
  `Going further back, we heard a lot about effort to leverage the benefits of CREST such as alerts, remediation, etc., to help operators in identifying and prioritize issue coverage in their operations. Can you talk about what you see as the big opportunities and challenges for CREST`,
  `Programming language which supports fundamental memory management operations and which supports all necessary low-level and high-level language functionality`,
  `The primary unique feature in the Apple iPad Mini is its performance. Powered by a dual-core 2GHz Intel Atom processor, the iPad Mini delivers an impressive performance throughout all three operating modes.

  `Persevering transitional projection caused by turning out-of-competition suspension occurs when the driver is about to compete on the last lap of the race and receives the disqualification penalty before actually competing. This delay gives a cheater enough time to obtain a copy of the driver's required Unfinished Entry, obtained when the driver was removed from the race. If the Unfinished Entry contains the correct driver's name, the correct winning lap time and the driver's new unallocated registration number, the cheater can either win the race with a new car, or re-enter the race with the car he or she won it in.`,

  `Genes or gene products could play a part, as is the case with some more complex agents that interfere with the work of key enzymes like NF-κB. Still, researchers who have linked NF-κB inhibition to Parkinson's disease suspect it may be an indirect target, and the plan is to test the drug on NF-κB.  `,
  `Further studies are planned to determine whether Trantrel and other drugs can slow down or prevent the disease process in which defective mitochondria are involved.`,
  `Advanced system-worthy capacity in a vehicle that'll be only marginally more expensive than the F-150 pickup. For most buyers, this is all a positive, because it helps shape and hold the landscape for the full-size pickup market.`,
  `I'm sure many analysts and marketers will also be keen to weigh in on the parameters of a new Delta compact pickup. What will make it a compelling feature? What areas is it likely to neglect? How does it compensate for its very poor full-size truck selling performance? And finally, what will make this pickup stand out from its competitors, both foreign and domestic, in a post-Trump era`,
  `Information sciences often model operations or technologies rather than existing phenomena. Similar to traditional business research, information sciences program work in relation to a market or a service product. Many kinds of qualitative studies may focus on a particular type of outcome or target audience.`,
  `Business-focused didactic emulation in software development. Qualitative R&D uses a range of tools and techniques, and evaluates programming using open-ended discussions and problem-solving activities. Qualitative research provides a structured assessment of the thinking process and a series of recommendations for developing an idea or proposal, or developing a method or program. Traditional business research does not provide a reliable method of understanding the creative process. Some, but not all, qualitative methods are systematically predictive.`,
